Please respond thoroughly (at least two sentences for each question) to the following three questions.

1. Describe an experience you had this semester where you saw the power of functions.
When I was writing the code for the final assignment which was a calculator for computing medical doses, I was able to appreciate the use of functions because it was easier to use the code that was already defined in a function.
Also, during the time that I was writing the code for the receipt.py assignment, I learned how to call the functions to complete the task. Functionscan also make the code easier to read by other programmers.


2. In your judgment, what is the value of test functions?
Test functions are important because it is good practice to test the functions as a programmer. Test functions also ensure that there are no errors in the written functions. I think it is better to test the functions as a programmer first, rather than the user finding the errors when the program goes live.



3. Describe your process for troubleshooting and fixing a program that has a problem. What is one thing you can do to improve your process?
My process would be to run the program first and look at the errors that are listed in the Terminal. After looking at the errors, I can then try fixing it and run it again as debugging. Another way to fix an issue is to run a debugger. However, there are also times that I just need to have a break before continuing to find the solution. I can improve this by doing more practice in programming.
